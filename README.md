# BeatShot-Project

A simple rhythm game where you play as a ball with a cannon trying to defend yourself from assorted enemies. Be careful though; your own shots will ricochet around the level and are dangerous to you as well. Shoot at approaching enemies, dodge their attacks, and most importantly, stay in sync with the music.
